### lab1 - concurrent programming in java
- [x] run multiple threads (extending the Thread class)
- [x] run multiple threads (implementing the Runnable interface)

### lab2 - semaphores
- [x] synchronize multiple threads using binary semaphores
- [x] "eating philosophers" problem

### lab3 - wait(), notify()
- [x] synchronize multiple threads using wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
- [x] "producers and consumers" problem

### lab4 - lock, condition
- [x] synchronize multiple threads using lock and conditions
- [x] "producers and consumers" problem

### lab5 - starvation, deadlock
- [x] observe starvation
- [x] cause a deadlock

### lab6 - ticket monitor
- [x] extract buffer out of the monitor

### lab7 - active object
- [x] implement producers and consumers problem using active object pattern

### lab8 - active object
- [x] compare active object and monitor based approaches 

### lab9 - active object vs monitor
- [x] write report showing differences, between performance of active object and monitor based approaches

### lab10 - csp
- [x] install jcsp library
- [x] implement producers/consumers problem according to csp pattern
