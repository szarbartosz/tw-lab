JCSP
Channels:
An input-end is used for reading from the channel; an output-end is used for writing to the channel.
A process should not be given a whole channel â€“ only the end that it needs.


SharedChannelOutputInt - The interface contains only one method - write(int o). This method will block the calling process until the int has been accepted by the channel

program operation:
- declared number of producers are created
- declared number of consumers are created
- distributed buffer with declared number of elements is created

producer:
- before launch proper outputs are set - each producer has assigned channels of all buffer parts
- data is produced in an infinite loop

buffer part:
- in constructor any2oneInt channel is assigned to each buffer part (parametrised capacity) - it's output is assigned to each producer
- before launch proper outputs are set - each buffer part has assigned channels of all consumers
- data is fetched from producers and passed to consumers in an infinite loop

consumer:
- in constructor any2oneInt channel is assigned to each consumer (parametrised capacity) - it's output is assigned to each buffer part
- data is fetched in an infinite loop
